# More About Profitocracy

## <a name="503020rule"></a> What is a 50-30-20 rule

The 50-30-20 rule is a common way to allocate the spending categories in your personal or household budget.
The rule targets 50% of your after-tax income toward necessities, 30% toward things you don‚Äôt need‚Äîbut make
life a little nicer and the final 20% toward paying down debt and/or adding to your savings.

## Terminologies Used in Profitocracy

### üíº Profile

A **Profile** represents all your financial activity in one place. It tracks your expenses and calculates amounts for primary, secondary, and savings expenses. Additionally, it provides insights into your daily spending as well as categorized expenses for better organization.

### üßæ Transaction

A **Transaction** is an operation that moves funds. It can either be an **income** (e.g., your salary) or an **expense** (e.g., groceries, rent). For expense transactions, you‚Äôll need to specify:
- The **type** of expense: primary, secondary, or savings.
- The **amount** spent.

You can also optionally provide additional details such as:
- **Spending category** (default is "None").
- **Description** of the transaction.
- **Date** of the operation.

### üíµ Actual and Planned Amounts of Expenses

In Profitocracy, most of the data displayed on the **Home Screen** revolves around expenses. An **expense** is represented by two key values:
- **Actual Amount:** The real amount of money spent for a specific type or category.
- **Planned Amount:** The amount Profitocracy suggests as your spending limit for each category or type.

This balance between actual and planned amounts helps you stay in control of your financial goals.

### üìä Category

A **Category** is a grouping tool for your transactions. Each category can be customized with:
- A **name** (e.g., Food, Entertainment).
- An optional **planned amount** for the month (set during creation on the **Settings Screen**).

Once created, you can track your category-wise spending on the **Home Screen.**

- If a planned amount is set, Profitocracy compares your spending against it for better tracking.
- If no planned amount is defined, the app simply displays the total expenses for the category during the ongoing month.

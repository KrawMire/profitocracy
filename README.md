# Introduction

**Profitocracy** is a budget control mobile application that helps
people to track their expenses following 50-30-20 rule.

## Key Features of Profitocracy

- ðŸ’° **Track your expenses by following [50-30-20 rule](#503020rule);**
- ðŸ“Š **Create, set limits and track your own spending categories;**
- ðŸ“… **Automatically plan your budget for the month;**
- ðŸ”’ **Profitocracy does not send your data to third parties. All your data is stored on your device.**

## Supported Platforms

Profitocracy is created using .NET MAUI and can be launched on different platforms, but the main of them are:

- iOS;
- Android.

## <a name="503020rule"></a> What is 50-30-20 rule

The 50-30-20 rule is a common way to allocate the spending categories in your personal or household budget. 
The rule targets 50% of your after-tax income toward necessities, 30% toward things you donâ€™t needâ€”but make 
life a little nicer and the final 20% toward paying down debt and/or adding to your savings.

## Terminologies Used in Profitocracy

### ðŸ’¼ Profile

Profile is an entity that tracks all of your expenses in a single place. 
It also calculates amounts for main, secondary and saving expenses, your 
every day expenses and expenses by categories.

### ðŸ§¾ Transaction

Transaction is a unit of moving funds. It could be an income (salary, for example) or expense (food, apartments) operation.
If it is expense operation your will need to specify the type of this expense - main, secondary or saving, - and its amount.
Optionally, you can specify also spending category (`None` by default), description and date of this transaction.

### ðŸ’µ Actual amount and planned amount of expenses

Almost everything that you can see at Home screen is an expense. Expense, in terms of Profitocracy, is an entity with
two values: *actual amount* and *plannedAmount*. Actual amount is your actual amount of spending of any type or category.
Planned amount is a planned by Profitocracy amount of money that you should not go beyond for every category or type.

### ðŸ“Š Category

Category is a special aggregation unit for your transactions. You can specify its name and planned amount for a month 
while creation process at **Settings** screen. Then you will be able to track them at **Home** screen. If you have not
specified planned amount for the category, Profitocracy will just calculate and show you the total amount of expenses 
for the category while current month.

For now, the only platform you can install without needing to build the application by yourself is to install it to Android device
through *.apk* file.
